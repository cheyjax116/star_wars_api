What I learned: <br>
This project helped me to reacclimatize myself to React and Bootstrap as well as introduce me to several React Hooks including useEffect and useState. It also allowed me to familiarize myself with the React-Paginate npm component and with fetching data using Axios. I ran into many bugs during development and while they were super frustrating during the process, in hindsight, I'm glad I encountered them because I learned a ton by resolving each of them.
